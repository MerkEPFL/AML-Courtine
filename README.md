TODOs:

Samuele:
- Adapt Load
- Adapt code with "InitializeGaitEvents"
- Gait detection with velocity
- Stick plot zy-axis

Lena:
- Look if ANOVA is appropriate
- Continue on k-means (max 2 variables) (brainstorming look at k-NN, Gaussian mixture       
  models)
- PCA

Laure: 
- Rename healthy segmentation
- Ground truth with TOE
- Create matrices for PCA

Ludovica:
