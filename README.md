Let's analyse this gait!

Code to run : 
- mainKin.m : launches segmentation of raw data and EMG denoising + all the processing of kinematic data => returns kinematic feature matrix
- mainEMG.m : launches segmentation of raw data and EMG denoising + all the processing of emg data => returns EMG feature matrix
- mainPCA.m : fetches features matrix + launches all the Principle Components Analysis with associated plots that were tested + ANOVA analysis.
